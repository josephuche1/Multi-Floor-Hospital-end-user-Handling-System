# Multi Floor Hospital End-user Handling System
This project is serves as a testament to everything that I have learned so far in Java and not Java but also Object Oriented Programming. I will continue to improve this project as time passes and I will continue to implement new features.

Here is a list of some things that I learned during this course:
<ul>
  <li>Classes</li>
  <li>Abstraction and Inheritance</li>
  <li>Interfaces</li>
  <li>Exception Handling</li>
  <li>GUI(Swing)</li>
  <li>Event Handling</li>
  <li>and so much more ...</li>
</ul>

I look forward to learning more new things in the future.
